# APODWall
APODWall is a low dependancy, multi-platform application for downloading the Astronomy Picture of the Day, and setting it as desktop wallpaper. If the day's APOD has already been downloaded it generates a random APOD.

#### **Some of the customability options:**
+ image quality
+ crop ratio (crop image to resolution before setting as wallpaper)
+ minimum starting size of image to set as a wallpaper
+ where and how much of everything to save/keep logged.

*APODWall is a WIP personal project using MIT license. Some things included in the program may be a placholder for future plans. I do my best will keep the functuality working on the master branch. The programs design may change durastically.*

## **Installation:**
+ Copy APODWall.py, config.toml, and config.py to the directory you want.
+ Edit the config.toml file to your needs/liking.
+ Run the application (APODWall.py)

## **Dependancies**
