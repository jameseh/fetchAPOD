# APODWall
WIP APOD wallpaper program. Currently does not have a GUI. Can set the daily apod as wallpaper if the daily has been set already set a random apod. Tons of settings, aspect ratio to crop, min image size to set as bg, etc. Saves a csv format log of all images downloaded, including what didn't make it past min size check. Works on any operating system. MIT license, feel free to do whatever you want with the code.
